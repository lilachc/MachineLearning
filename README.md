# Distinguishing Malicious from Benign
## Machine Learning Based File Classification

Description:
This is my submission for the final project of the Introduction to Machine Learning course at TAU, Faculty of Engineering. The task involved developing a robust classification model to distinguish between malicious and non-malicious files. For a comprehensive understanding, please refer to the detailed report. Special thanks to the academic staff, including Dor Bank, the lecturer, and Ilan Vasilevsky, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the course.
